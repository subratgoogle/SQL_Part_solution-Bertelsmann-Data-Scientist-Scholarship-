If you don’t group by any columns, you’ll get a

/* Lesson 31.6 - Video: More on Subqueries */

/* In the first subquery you wrote, you
created a table that you could then query again in the
FROM statement. However, if you are only returning a
single value, you might use that value in a logical
statement like WHERE, HAVING, or even SELECT - the
value could be nested within a CASE statement. */

/* PRO TIP */

/* Note that you should not include an alias when
ou write a subquery in a conditional statement.
This is because the subquery is treated as an
individual value (or set of values in the IN case)
rather than as a table. */

/* Also, notice the query here compared a single value.
If we returned an entire column IN would need to be
used to perform a logical argument. If we are returning
an entire table, then we must use an ALIAS for the table,
and perform additional logic on the entire table. */
